# A config file can contain multiple experiments.
# These are run in sequence, where the order is determined by lexicographic
# ordering of the experiment names.
# It's also possible to run experiments in parallel:
# by default, experiments are skipped when the corresponding log file already
# exists, i.e. when the experiment is currently running or has already finnished.
# That means it's safe to run ``xnmt my_config.yaml`` on the same config file
# multiple times.
#
# This particular examples runs the same experiment, changing only the amount
# of dropout. model, train, evaluate settings are shared using YAML anchors,
# see here for more information: http://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html
