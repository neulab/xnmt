# A config file can contain multiple experiments.
# These are run in sequence.
# It's also possible to run experiments in parallel:
# by default, experiments are skipped when the corresponding log file already
# exists, i.e. when the experiment is currently running or has already finnished.
# That means it's safe to run ``xnmt my_config.yaml`` on the same config file
# multiple times.
#
# This particular examples runs the same experiment, changing only the amount
# of dropout. model, training, evaluate settings are shared using YAML anchors,
# see here for more information: http://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html
#
# There are two ways of specifying multiple experiments: the dictionary-way and the
# list-way. The dictionary-way is shown below. Here, dictionary keys are experiment
# names and the values are !Experiment objects. The order is determined by lexicographic
# ordering of the experiment names.
