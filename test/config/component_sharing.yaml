# This illustrates component and parameter sharing.
# Here, 3 different ways of sharing are distinguished, with increasing complexity.
# This follows YAML syntax: '&' denotes a named anchor, '*' denotes a reference to an anchor.
#
# - value-sharing: sharing a simple parameter value (e.g. a string or a scalar)
# - config-sharing: sharing the configuration of a complex component.
#                   this means we copy a component: the component is created twice with identical configuration.
# - reference-sharing: sharing reference to a complex object.
#                   this means the component is only created once, which also leads to DyNet parameters being shared.
#                   Since YAML doesn't distinguish between a copy and a reference, we implement reference-sharing
#                   by adding a unique _xnmt_id field to the component that is to be shared. During deserialization,
#                   whenever a component's _xnmt_id is equal to the corresponding field of a component that has
#                   has already been initialized, we re-use that initialized component instead of creating a new one.
