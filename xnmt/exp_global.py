class ExpGlobal(Serializable):
  """
  An object that holds global settings that can be referenced by components wherever appropriate.

  Args:
    model_file: Location to write model file to
    log_file: Location to write log file to
    dropout: Default dropout probability that should be used by supporting components but can be overwritten
    weight_noise: Default weight noise level that should be used by supporting components but can be overwritten
    default_layer_dim: Default layer dimension that should be used by supporting components but can be overwritten
    param_init: Default parameter initializer that should be used by supporting components but can be overwritten
    bias_init: Default initializer for bias parameters that should be used by supporting components but can be overwritten
    truncate_dec_batches: whether the decoder drops batch elements as soon as these are masked at some time step.
    save_num_checkpoints: save DyNet parameters for the most recent n checkpoints, useful for model averaging/ensembling
    loss_comb_method: method for combining loss across batch elements ('sum' or 'avg').
    commandline_args: Holds commandline arguments with which XNMT was launched
    placeholders: these will be used as arguments for a format() call applied to every string in the config.
                  For example, ``placeholders: {"PATH":"/some/path"} will cause each occurence of ``"{PATH}"`` in a
                  string to be replaced by ``"/some/path"``. As a special variable, ``EXP_DIR`` can be specified to
                  overwrite the default location for writing models, logs, and other files.
