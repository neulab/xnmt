  An object that holds global settings that can be referenced by components wherever appropriate.

    bias_init: Default initializer for bias parameters that should be used by supporting components but can be overwritten
    save_num_checkpoints: save DyNet parameters for the most recent n checkpoints, useful for model averaging/ensembling
    loss_comb_method: method for combining loss across batch elements ('sum' or 'avg').

    placeholders: these will be used as arguments for a format() call applied to every string in the config.
