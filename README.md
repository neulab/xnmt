eXtensible Neural Machine Translation
=====================================

This is a repository for the extensible neural machine translation toolkit `xnmt`.
The over-arching goal of `xnmt` is that it be easy to use for research, and thus it supports
a modular design that means that new methods should be easy to implement by adding new modules.
It is coded in Python based on [DyNet](http://github.com/clab/dynet).

More information can be found in the [documentation](http://readthedocs.org/projects/xnmt/badge/?version=latest).
